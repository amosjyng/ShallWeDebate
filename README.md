Setup
-----

Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html), run `vagrant up` and `vagrant provision`, and go to [127.0.0.1:8080/mockup.html](http://127.0.0.1:8080/mockup.html).

Note that the project directory on your host computer is linked to the `/vagrant/` directory of the Vagrant virtual machine.

Documentation
-------------

SSH into the Vagrant machine using `vagrant ssh`, go to the project directory using `cd /vagrant/`, and run `make documentation`. You should now be able to open the newly created `js/doc/index.html` file inside your project directory.
