Setup
-----

For first-time set up:

1. Install [Vagrant](http://www.vagrantup.com/downloads.html)
2. Run `vagrant up; vagrant reload`
3. Go to [127.0.0.1:8080/mockup.html](http://127.0.0.1:8080/).

To re-provision the Vagrant machine after pulling new changes, run `vagrant provision`.

Note that the project directory on your host computer is linked to the `/vagrant/` directory of the Vagrant virtual machine.

Documentation
-------------

SSH into the Vagrant machine using `vagrant ssh`, go to the project directory using `cd /vagrant/`, and run `make documentation`. You should now be able to open the newly created `js/doc/index.html` file inside your project directory.
